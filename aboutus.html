          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>The CSE Shop is all about creating and spreading holistic sex ed information. We believe that knowledge is power
            and that it is important to empower other people. 
            We understand that there are many factors that could stop the spread of sex education and that is why 
            we created a space which exists outside of everyday politics. A space where prejudice and judgement are not allowed. 
            We aim to not only spread life-saving information but to be a vehicle that fosters acceptance in all forms. 
            Our information is well-researched and verified by active practitioners in the health and psychology fields.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>If you have any comments or questions about our content feel free to contact us. We aim to be inclusive 
            and shy away from making anyone feel marginalized, insulted, and discriminated against. 
          </p>
