          <h2>What is CSE?</h2>
          <p>CSE stands for Comprehensive Sexuality Education</p>
          <br>
          
          <h2>Why is CSE important?</h2>
          <p>A comprehensive approach to human development and sexuality is emphasized in comprehensive sexual 
            education. The intention is to provide teenagers the skills and beliefs necessary to make morally 
            sound choices regarding their social and sexual lives in a society that prioritizes sexual and 
            reproductive health and rights. Programmes for sexual education have the beneficial impact of 
            reducing the amount of contradicting and confusing information that teenagers are exposed to about 
            their gender and sexuality from a variety of unreliable sources. It is commonly acknowledged that 
            if the human rights component is disregarded, sexual education alone will not be sufficient to 
            empower teenagers to form healthy standards about themselves, relationships, and sexual health. 
            Therefore, this chapter takes a rights-based stance when it comes to comprehensive sexuality 
            education. The focus of advocacy is on giving teenagers the chance to learn vital life skills and 
            form healthy attitudes and beliefs around their sexuality. 
          </p>

          <h2>What does CSE truly cover?</h2>
          <p>The following current cross-cutting topics that are common among teenagers are covered in 
            CSE: Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights; Sexuality Education; STD Prevention; 
            Family Planning and Unwanted Pregnancy Prevention; Gender-Based Violence Prevention. 
            Each section offers recommendations for contextualized strategies for successful 
            teenage sexual expression.
